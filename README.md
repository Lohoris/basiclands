A checklist for an MTC Basic Land collection :D

## History
- I coded this in 2010-2011.
- I've lost the original repository, but I've found this code, which I think it's the final version.
- I also have the database, but I still have to upload it.
- This needs to be fixed, as it's referencing external libraries.
