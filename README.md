A checklist for an MTG Basic Land collection :D

## History
- I coded this in 2010-2011.
- I've lost the original repository, but I've found this code, which I think it's the final version.
- I also have the database, but I still have to upload it.
- This needs to be fixed, as it's referencing external libraries.

## License
### Source code
The source code of this project is _ideally_ distributed under MS-PL (Microsoft Public License). See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

The license template header will be progressively applied to each eligible file.

Unfortunately until we have done so the default "all rights reserved" has to apply.

### Images
The images included here are likely random placeholders.

They might or might not have a license.

They should be replaced with guaranteed free ones eventually.
